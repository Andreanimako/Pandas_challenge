PyCity Schools Analysis

The data below is an analysis of the performance of high school students of a particular school district during their recent district-wide standardised tests for math and reading.The raw data provided 2 separate data sets providing information about the school,the school ID, the school type,the number of students,their current grade,gender and ID, each student's score in math and reading and the schools' budget.this data was then merged into one dataset- school_data complete and further anaysed. The data was analysed by the district, to provide an overall summary of the total number of schools within the district, the total schools' budget, the total number of students, the average math and reading scores and the perecentage of students passing math only, reading only and percentage passing both. The data was then analysed by school, giving the average performance and percentage pass rates by school and providing in addition, the budget per student, per school. the data was then sorted to show the top 5 perfoming schools and the lowest 5 performingg schools based on their overall passing rate.The scores were then analysed by subject, for math and then, reading, and the average scores per grade recorded for each school.The data was further analysed by school spending, school size and school type and summary dataframes created for each.

Conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis:

1. The top 5 performing schools were all Charter schools whilst the bottom 5 performing schools were all district schools.the top 5 schools had overall passing rate above 90 percent, whilst the lowest 5 had overall pass rate hovering around 50 percent. This suggests that sudents in charter schools perform better than those in regular district schools.
2. Schools that spent the highest amount per student had the lowest average scores in both math and reading and also had the lowest average overall pass rate, as opposed to schools that spent the least amount per student, which had the highest average overal pass rate.
